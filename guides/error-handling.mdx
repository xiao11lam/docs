## Overview

Effective error handling ensures your integration with Alto Health is reliable and provides clear feedback when issues occur. This guide covers common errors, their causes, and how to resolve them.

## HTTP Status Codes

Alto Health uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of API requests:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-check" title="200 OK">
    Request succeeded. The response body contains the requested data.

    **When you'll see this:** Successful document uploads, extraction requests, and job status checks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-xmark" title="400 Bad Request">
    The request was malformed or missing required parameters.

    **Common causes:**
    - Missing required fields
    - Invalid data format
