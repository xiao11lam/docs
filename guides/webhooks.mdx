## Overview

Webhooks allow you to receive automatic notifications when Alto Health completes processing your documents. Instead of repeatedly checking job status, Alto Health will send the results directly to your server when processing is complete.

## How Webhooks Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Make a Request">
    Include a `webhook_url` parameter when requesting entity extraction or batch comparison.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automation Begins">
    Alto Health queues your automation for processing asynchronously.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automation Completes">
    When automation finishes (successfully or with errors), Alto Health sends a POST request to your webhook URL.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Handle the Response">
    Your server receives the results and processes them accordingly.
  </Step>
