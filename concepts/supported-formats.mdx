    For scanned documents, use 300 DPI or higher to ensure optimal OCR accuracy and data extraction.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ensure Legibility">
    Verify that handwritten notes, stamps, and signatures are clearly visible before uploading.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Include All Pages">
    Upload complete referral documents with all pages, including attachments and supporting clinical information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Native Formats When Possible">
    Native PDF or DOCX files provide better extraction accuracy than scanned images.
